Figure2: Estimation of genotyping accuracy from the 
standardized distance to the reference set: Based on the 
original 1000 genomes data, we simulated different accuracy 
groups to derive a standardized distance for different 
genotyping accuracies. The intersection of the distance of your 
vcf file with the reference curve indicates the error rate. A 
genotyping accuracy below 0.0001 is regarded as good quality. 
For an exome target region of 30MB this translates to less than 
3000 genotyping errors. For a usual individual we expect 
around 30,000 true variants per exome: Thus an accuracy of 
below 0.0001 means a positive predictive value above 90%. 
When the estimated accuracy of your data set is above 0.001, 
make sure first, that the enrichment technique that you used, 
really targets at least the consensus exome of the 1000 
genomes project (e.g. SureSelect Human All Exon Kit, 
NimbleGen SeqCep EZ, Illumina TruSeq Exome Enrichment Kit) 
or that you uploaded a whole genome vcf file. If so and your 
accuracy is still poor you might discuss with GeneTalk's 
technical support, how to improve the quality of your NGS data.
