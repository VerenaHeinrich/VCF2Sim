\textcolor{gray}{Figure1: Distance of your exome sample to a high-quality reference set of the 1000 genomes project: Thegenotype-weighted similarity metric compares the sequence variants of your vcf file to reference samples of the best matching population background of the 1000 genomes project. In this metric the detection of a disproportionally high number of rare variants indicates a high false positive error rate and too few common variants point to a high false negative error rate. A short distance to the high-quality reference set stands for a good genotyping accuracy of your exome sample. The distances are visualized with nonmetric multidimensional scaling, MDS.}
